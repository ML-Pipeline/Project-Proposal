# 94-845 Applied ML Project Proposal
Classification and Time Series Analysis of Bitcoin Users
Project by: Prakhar Mishra, Simran Handa and Malvika Singh

Please refer to ML_Pipeline_Project.ipynb python notebook for detailed code implementing our analysis.
We have used dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data/version/1#_=

This is our primary dataset. We have added columns like Modeled Price and Number of competing currencies in this primary dataset which help us in predicting the time-series forecast model.
To run the python notebook, follow the follwing steps:
Step 1: 
Download the file on your local machine. Ensure that the local machine meets the following specifications:
Hardware:
Processor Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7200 CPU @2.50 GHz 2.70 GHz and an installed RAM of 8.00 GB (7.73 GB Usable). The system is a 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor.
Software:
Experiment is performed on Google CoLab having its own RAM and Disk space in Chrome. Python 3 was used for building the notebook. Laptop used Windows 10 OS. 
MAC OS also supported.

Step 2:
Download and install all necessary libraries if required. Although, if run using Google CoLab which we have used, the dependencies do not need to be installed explicitly.
For installing python on local machine, if running locally without Google CoLab - Download Python 3 available at https://www.python.org/downloads/
Install required libraries like numpy, tensorflow, scikit etc. using terminal and pip command -pip install numpy
for example.
Download notebook and hit the exceute/run button after all the packages are downloaded and installed.

Step 3:
If running using Google CoLab, go to File -> Open Notebook -> Provide path where you have downloaded the notebook.
Once opened in Google Coab, specify the directory for the data and the code is ready to be implemented.

Step 4:
Download the data2.csv file provided in this github repo and specify the path according to your loacl machine before running the code.
